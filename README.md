### Reporting Guidelines

Only the winner reports the result of a match.
A match counts only for the rating if it is a live played match (no money play or chouettes)
with both players agreeing beforehand that it will count for the rating.


### Report Match on GitHub

Frequent players are included in dropdown menus to ease the match reporting.
When a player, who is not included in dropdown menus is involved, the name of the player has to be typed in.

- Report Match:  is used for matches between players that are normally present during the Saturday sessions.
  Matches are reported using dropdown menus for the winner/loser name and the match length.
- Report New Player Match:  is used for matches with a player not in the dropdown menus, for example, when a new player joins.
  Matches are reported using dropdown menus or editing the name manual for the winner/loser name and the match length.

To report any of the two match types go to Actions, select the match type, click on RUN WORKFLOW.
Select or type in the Winner, the Loser and the Match Length.
Click on RUN WORKFLOW again to submit the match report.

The rating list will be updated within 20 seconds.
