## Reporting

Frequent players are included in dropdown menus to ease the match reporting.
When a player, who is not included in dropdown menus is involved, the names of both players have to be typed in.

- Usual Matches -> Actions:  are matches between players that are normally present during the Saturday sessions.
Usual matches can be reported using dropdown menus for the winner/loser name and the match length.
To report a Usual Match, start a GitHub Action from the Actions menu.
- Unusual Matches -> Issues:  are matches with a player not in the dropdown menus, for example, when a new player joins.
To report an Unusual Match, report a GitHub issue labeled as "match" with the title in one of the following formats...

- WinnerName LoserName MatchLength
- Winner Name, Loser Name, MatchLength

### Reporting Guidelines

Only the winner reports the result of a match.

- The winner chooses his name, for a new player: type in your name.
- The winner chooses the name of his opponent, for a new player: type in the name of the opponent.
- The winner chooses the length of the match.
- The winner labels the issue as match.
- The winner clicks on the button submit.
